# Quantum Software Engineer Roadmap (3-Month Plan)

This repository tracks a structured 12-week roadmap to become hire-ready as a quantum software engineer. The plan includes learning core quantum computing concepts, contributing to open-source projects, and building a portfolio of practical quantum applications.

## Duration

**3 Months**  
**Commitment**: ~20–25 hours/week

## Goals

- Master core and advanced quantum computing concepts
- Build a strong GitHub portfolio with at least 10 projects (beginner to advanced)
- Contribute meaningfully to open-source quantum projects (e.g., Qiskit, PennyLane)
- Prepare for internships or junior quantum software roles

## Topics Covered

- Qubits, gates, measurement, entanglement
- Quantum circuits, visualization, Bloch spheres
- Quantum algorithms: Grover's, Shor's, VQE, QPE
- Quantum error correction and noise modeling
- Hybrid quantum-classical ML with variational circuits
- Building and deploying production-ready quantum apps

## Tools & Frameworks

- **Languages**: Python  
- **Quantum SDKs**: Qiskit, PennyLane, Cirq  
- **Simulation**: Qiskit Aer, IBM Quantum  
- **ML**: scikit-learn, Qiskit Machine Learning  
- **Visualization**: matplotlib, Plotly, Streamlit  
- **Backend**: FastAPI, Flask  
- **Deployment**: Hugging Face Spaces, Docker  
- **Version Control**: Git, GitHub  
- **DevOps**: GitHub Actions (for CI)
